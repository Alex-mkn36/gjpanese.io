Hello this is a software project designed to outsourceing https://schoolhub.ai/prompt/chat-for-students to automate the process of engaging with Japanese dialect, more specificly the grammar which has minimal online resources.
If you encounter issues with the driver you need to go to https://googlechromelabs.github.io/chrome-for-testing and choose a chrome driver compatidable with your device and is up to date. You must then extract the driver and move it into the file. If you have further issues contact me at alex.m.k.n36@gmail.com.
